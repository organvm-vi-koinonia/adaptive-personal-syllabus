Writing Guide for Derek: Structure, Exploration, and Momentum  
  
This guide is designed to help you break through creative blocks, explore story ideas, and refine narrative structure. It’s broken into theory sections followed by practical exercises so you can immediately apply what you learn.  
  
Introduction: Embracing the Exploratory Phase  
  
Before diving into structure, let go of the idea that your first attempts need to be good. Writing isn’t about producing a perfect draft—it’s about discovery. The first stage is exploratory writing, also called vomit drafting:  
	•	No one will see this but you.  
	•	Your job is just to get ideas down.  
	•	You don’t need to start at the beginning—write whatever comes to mind.  
	•	This phase includes notes, sketches, and brainstorming—not just prose.  
  
	Activity: 10-Minute Vomit Draft  
		•	Set a timer for 10 minutes.  
	•	Write anything related to your story (character backstory, a scene idea, a theme).  
	•	Don’t stop. Don’t edit. Just write through the mess.  
  
1. The Core of a Story: Change Through Antagonism  
  
At its heart, a story is about a protagonist undergoing change due to an antagonistic force rising in their life.  
  
Key Principles:  
  
✅ A character must be making decisions. Every scene should have a choice.  
✅ Antagonism isn’t just a villain. It’s anything that creates conflict (internal struggles, natural disasters, personal demons).  
✅ Every story is about transformation. If the protagonist doesn’t change, the story doesn’t move.  
  
	Activity: Find the Antagonist  
		1.	Choose a character you’re working with.  
	2.	Identify what opposes them—what’s stopping them from getting what they want?  
	3.	Ask: How does this force escalate? How does the protagonist adapt?  
	4.	Write a scene where the protagonist must make a choice under pressure.  
  
2. The Positive and Negative Pulse of Storytelling  
  
Every scene, every chapter, every moment in a story should have a pulse—a shift in emotional energy.  
	•	Scenes aren’t just things happening; they shift in meaning.  
	•	A scene starts in one state and ends in another. (Positive → Negative, Negative → Positive)  
  
Scene Start	Action	Scene End  
Hopeful	Protagonist receives bad news	Desperate  
Angry	Argument turns into reconciliation	Relieved  
Confused	Discovers a clue	Determined  
  
	Activity: Scene Pulse Mapping  
		1.	Write a short scene.  
	2.	Identify the emotional state at the start.  
	3.	Identify how the scene shifts by the end.  
	4.	If there’s no shift, revise it to introduce a positive or negative pulse change.  
  
3. Macro & Micro Dramatic Structure (Story as a Graph)  
  
A story is like a wave, rising and falling with tension and resolution.  
	•	Big Picture (Macro Pulse): The whole story has highs and lows.  
	•	Small Picture (Micro Pulse): Each scene also has highs and lows.  
  
📈 Macro (Full Story)  
	•	Rise: Character gets a win.  
	•	Fall: They hit a roadblock.  
	•	Rise: They find hope.  
	•	Fall: It gets worse.  
	•	Climactic rise: They make the final choice.  
  
📉 Micro (One Scene)  
	•	Starts tense.  
	•	Information is revealed.  
	•	Tension gets worse.  
	•	A choice is made.  
	•	Scene ends with a shift.  
  
	Activity: Graph Your Story  
		1.	Pick a story idea.  
	2.	Draw a simple wave:  
	•	Mark where things go up and where they go down.  
	•	Look for flat spots—places where the energy doesn’t shift.  
	•	Adjust so that every part of the story moves in some way.  
  
4. Five Essential Story Structures  
  
Different stories fit different structures. Here are five major ones to experiment with:  
  
A. Classic Dramatic Structure (Freytag’s Pyramid)  
  
Best for: Traditional dramas, plays, literary fiction.  
	•	Exposition – Introduce setting, characters, and stakes.  
	•	Rising Action – Introduce conflict, obstacles build tension.  
	•	Climax – The peak moment of tension (a major decision, battle, revelation).  
	•	Falling Action – Consequences of the climax unfold.  
	•	Resolution – Ties up loose ends, establishes the new normal.  
  
B. Three-Act Structure  
  
Best for: Films, comics, graphic novels, novels.  
	•	Act 1: Setup – Establish the protagonist, world, and inciting incident.  
	•	Act 2: Confrontation – The protagonist struggles, faces obstacles, and reaches a low point.  
	•	Act 3: Resolution – The final confrontation leads to a conclusion.  
  
C. The Hero’s Journey (Joseph Campbell)  
  
Best for: Epic quests, fantasy, sci-fi, coming-of-age stories.  
	1.	Ordinary World – The hero’s normal life.  
	2.	Call to Adventure – Something disrupts their world.  
	3.	Refusal of the Call – The hero resists change.  
	4.	Meeting the Mentor – Guidance appears.  
	5.	Crossing the Threshold – The hero enters the unknown.  
	6.	Tests, Allies, Enemies – Encounters that shape the journey.  
	7.	Approach to the Inmost Cave – A major challenge looms.  
	8.	The Ordeal – A moment of crisis.  
	9.	Reward (Seizing the Sword) – A breakthrough or treasure is gained.  
	10.	The Road Back – The hero returns to the ordinary world.  
	11.	Resurrection – A final test.  
	12.	Return with the Elixir – The hero brings knowledge or change back home.  
  
	Activity: Structure Your Idea  
		1.	Pick a story idea and apply one of these structures to it.  
	2.	Write a rough outline using the structure’s key steps.  
	3.	Expand one section into a full scene.  
  
5. Reverse Engineering Inspiration  
  
To sharpen storytelling instincts, analyze the stories you love.  
  
	Activity: Break Down a Favorite Story  
		1.	Pick a comic, graphic novel, or film that inspires you.  
	2.	Answer these questions:  
	•	What happens in each major section?  
	•	Where are the positive and negative pulse shifts?  
	•	What structure does it follow?  
	3.	Rewrite a scene from it in your own style.  
  
6. Back-and-Forth Brainstorming (Email Process)  
  
Instead of working alone, let’s email ideas back and forth to refine them.  
  
How This Works  
	1.	You send me an email with:  
	•	A rough idea.  
	•	A question or problem (e.g., “My character feels flat” or “I don’t know what happens next”).  
	2.	I reply with:  
	•	Ideas, clarifications, and challenges.  
	•	A short writing prompt to spark momentum.  
	3.	You respond with a new draft or idea.  
	4.	We repeat the cycle until it feels solid.  
  
Final Takeaways  
  
✅ Stories are about change. If a character isn’t making choices, they’re stuck.  
✅ Scenes must shift. Every scene should move from one state to another.  
✅ Positive & negative pulses drive tension.  
✅ The wave structure matters. Stories rise and fall in a rhythmic way.  
✅ Exploratory writing is messy. The goal is momentum, not perfection.  
✅ Keep the conversation going. Let’s email and refine ideas together.
