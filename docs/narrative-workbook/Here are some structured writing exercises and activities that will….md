Here are some structured writing exercises and activities that will help your brother generate ideas, get past the self-judgment phase, and develop a more fluid writing process.  
  
1. The Pixar Story Spine (Structured Narrative Exercise)  
  
This exercise provides a foundational structure for a story. It helps writers generate a compelling sequence of events.  
  
Template:  
	•	Once upon a time… (Establish setting and characters)  
	•	Every day… (Show the normal world)  
	•	Until one day… (Introduce inciting incident)  
	•	Because of that… (Cause and effect sequence begins)  
	•	Because of that… (Escalation)  
	•	Because of that… (Further escalation)  
	•	Until finally… (Climax/resolution)  
	•	And ever since then… (New normal)  
  
Activity:  
	•	Have him take three different genres (e.g., sci-fi, horror, romance) and use this structure to outline a quick story idea for each.  
	•	Expand the most interesting one into a 500-word draft.  
  
2. Vomit Drafting (Exploratory Writing)  
  
The goal here is to silence the inner critic. The draft is not meant to be good—it’s just meant to exist.  
  
Activity:  
	•	Set a timer for 10 minutes and write nonstop without deleting anything.  
	•	The only rule: You cannot stop writing. If you get stuck, write “I don’t know what happens next but maybe…” and keep going.  
	•	Repeat this exercise with different prompts:  
	•	“A character walks into a room and realizes something is missing.”  
	•	“A letter arrives that changes everything.”  
	•	“The protagonist overhears a conversation that they weren’t supposed to hear.”  
  
3. The Expand & Shrink Exercise  
  
This forces the writer to think about narrative economy and pacing.  
  
Activity:  
	1.	Write a story in one sentence.  
	2.	Expand it into a three-sentence version (beginning, middle, end).  
	3.	Expand it further into one paragraph.  
	4.	Expand again into three paragraphs.  
	5.	Keep stretching it until it reaches 1,000 words.  
  
4. Character Deep-Dive  
  
Characters are often more engaging when their history is well-developed, even if much of it doesn’t make it into the final draft.  
  
Activity:  
	•	Choose a character and answer:  
	•	What was their most formative childhood experience?  
	•	What do they regret the most?  
	•	What’s their biggest fear?  
	•	What’s in their pockets right now?  
	•	Write a journal entry from their perspective at three different points in their life: childhood, a crisis moment, and old age.  
  
5. The McKee Conflict Triangle (Story by Robert McKee)  
  
Robert McKee emphasizes the importance of conflict-driven storytelling. Every scene should have conflict to drive the narrative forward.  
  
Activity:  
	1.	Write a short scene with external conflict (protagonist vs. antagonist).  
	2.	Write the same scene but with internal conflict (protagonist wrestling with a decision).  
	3.	Rewrite the scene adding philosophical conflict (larger ideological struggle).  
  
6. The Object Story  
  
This exercise forces writers to craft a story from a mundane starting point.  
  
Activity:  
	•	Pick a random object (e.g., a key, a photograph, a broken watch).  
	•	Answer:  
	•	Who owns this object?  
	•	Why is it important?  
	•	How did they get it?  
	•	What happens if they lose it?  
	•	Expand this into a 300-word scene.  
  
7. Reverse Engineering a Story  
  
Sometimes, working backward helps writers see a clear path.  
  
Activity:  
	•	Write the ending first.  
	•	Work backward, writing the moment right before the ending.  
	•	Keep going, filling in key beats, until you reach the beginning.  
  
8. Story Collage  
  
A method for generating unexpected connections.  
  
Activity:  
	•	Write down three random settings, three characters, and three conflicts (e.g., “A train station, A scientist, A lost letter”).  
	•	Pick one from each category and write a 500-word flash fiction piece based on that combination.  
  
Final Thoughts  
  
Encourage your brother to detach from the idea of perfection. The point is to explore and build confidence. If he keeps writing exploratory drafts, he’ll develop instincts for which stories have momentum.
