Aligning McKee’s Story with McCloud’s Understanding Comics

Final Takeaways  
  
✅ Yes, McKee’s and McCloud’s chapters align well.  
✅ Every narrative principle from McKee has a direct equivalent in visual storytelling.  
✅ The workbook can maintain a 1:1 ratio between film storytelling and comic storytelling lessons.  
✅ The exercises for Derek will directly integrate lessons from both perspectives.  
  
Next Steps: How to Finalize the Workbook Structure  
	1.	Use this pairing system for organizing the Story vs. Comics comparison documents.  
	2.	Format each section with:  
	•	McKee’s lesson  
	•	McCloud’s counterpoint  
	•	A side-by-side breakdown using Whiplash as the test case.  
	•	An activity for application.  
	3.	Do you want examples from real comics for each chapter to reinforce the lessons?  
	4.	Would you like each document formatted as a single PDF per section or multiple PDFs for easier reference?  
  
  
Optimal Structure: Distributing McCloud’s Understanding Comics and Making Comics Across 19 Modules  
  
To ensure that McKee’s 19 chapters remain the master framework, while effectively integrating McCloud’s 9 chapters from Understanding Comics and 7 from Making Comics, we need a logical distribution where:  
	•	Each module contains one McKee chapter.  
	•	Each module contains one McCloud reference (either Understanding Comics or Making Comics).  
	•	Where necessary, McCloud chapters are split into logical sections to fit all 19 modules.

Why This Works  
  
✅ Maintains McKee as the master framework → Story remains the central organizing principle.  
✅ Distributes McCloud’s two books logically → Ensures all key chapters are covered in a meaningful way.  
✅ No module is overloaded → Each section has one McKee lesson, one McCloud lesson, a comparison, and two activities.  
✅ McCloud chapters are strategically split → Larger chapters (like The Six Steps and Blood in the Gutter) are reused in sections where relevant.  
✅ Maintains a logical reading pace → Each week has two structured reading assignments, one from story structure, one from visual execution.  
  
Next Steps  
	•	Approve this finalized structure before moving to full integration.  
	•	Would you like a visual roadmap (table, flowchart, or PDF) to accompany this?  
	•	Any refinements before moving forward?
