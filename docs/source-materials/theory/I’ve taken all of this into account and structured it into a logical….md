I’ve taken all of this into account and structured it into a logical, well-ordered guide that covers everything we discussed while making it engaging, actionable, and directly applicable to Derek’s work. I also made sure to expand on the section about studying inspirations, emphasizing the importance of varied influences so that he doesn’t just mimic one source but instead builds a unique artistic voice.  
  
Everything below flows as a step-by-step creative process, alternating between theory and activity to reinforce each lesson.  
  
The Writing Guide for Derek: Exploration, Structure, and Momentum  
  
Introduction: The Underground Work (The Iceberg Mentality)  
  
Before we dive into structure, embrace the idea that most writing isn’t meant to be seen by anyone but you. Think of Tarantino’s approach—he writes way more than what makes it onto the final screenplay. He knows every character’s history, every backstory, every detail—even if it never explicitly appears in the film.  
  
This kind of underground writing is your foundation. It helps you make better decisions because you understand the world and characters beyond the surface.  
  
Think of Writing Like an Iceberg  
	•	The top of the iceberg = What the audience sees (your finished story).  
	•	The huge mass underneath = All the unseen work (notes, research, backstory, drafts, alternate versions).  
  
👉 The more you explore below the surface, the stronger the visible story will be.  
  
1. Generating Story Ideas (From Logline to Expanded Narrative)  
  
A logline is the shortest version of a story—usually a one-sentence summary that captures the core premise.  
  
Example Loglines  
	1.	A washed-up boxer gets a second chance at greatness but must choose between fame and his integrity.  
	2.	A reclusive scientist discovers a portal to a parallel universe but risks erasing his own existence.  
	3.	A woman wakes up with no memory and finds a note in her pocket that reads: “Don’t trust them.”  
	4.	A struggling musician’s songs start predicting the future—but only tragic events.  
	5.	A detective investigating a string of murders finds all the victims are alternate versions of himself.  
  
Activity: Rewrite Each Logline Five Different Ways  
	1.	Change the genre – How does the story shift if it’s a horror, comedy, noir, sci-fi, fantasy?  
	2.	Change the protagonist – What if the lead was older, younger, a different gender, non-human?  
	3.	Change the conflict – What if instead of a villain, the struggle was against nature, time, or the protagonist’s own mind?  
	4.	Change the setting – What if it took place 1,000 years in the future, in feudal Japan, or in a dreamscape?  
	5.	Change the ending – What if the story’s resolution was tragic, ambiguous, cyclical, or surreal?  
  
2. Expanding an Idea (Different Story Structures)  
  
Once you’ve settled on an idea, the next step is to develop it in different forms to see what structure best fits.  
  
Activity: Expand Your Logline in Five Different Ways  
	1.	The Pixar Story Spine  
	•	Once upon a time…  
	•	Every day…  
	•	Until one day…  
	•	Because of that… (repeat 2-3 times)  
	•	Until finally…  
	•	And ever since then…  
	2.	A One-Paragraph Summary – Expand the logline into a 100-word synopsis.  
	3.	Three-Act Structure – Break it down into:  
	•	Act 1: Setup, introduction of the protagonist, inciting incident.  
	•	Act 2: Conflict escalation, protagonist struggles, major turning point.  
	•	Act 3: Climax and resolution.  
	4.	A Scene from the Middle – Instead of starting at the beginning, jump into a pivotal moment and write a scene where something shifts (a betrayal, a revelation, a choice).  
	5.	10 Tense Sentences – Summarize the story in 10 sentences, but make sure each one adds tension or raises the stakes.  
  
3. Studying Your Inspirations (Steal From Many, Not One)  
  
If you want to build something truly original, don’t just copy one thing you love—blend multiple inspirations. The best artists are an amalgamation of their influences, not just imitators of a single source.  
  
How to Analyze Your Favorite Works  
  
Pick two or three examples that inspire you—whether it’s a comic, film, novel, or game. Break it down like this:  
	1.	Plot Breakdown – Summarize the entire story in 5-7 bullet points.  
	2.	Character Decisions – How does the protagonist change based on the decisions they make?  
	3.	Pacing & Structure – When does tension rise? When does it fall?  
	4.	Scene Study – Pick one powerful scene and analyze:  
	•	What happens?  
	•	What changes from beginning to end?  
	•	What emotion is driving the scene?  
  
Activity: Create an “Influence Collage”  
	•	List 3-5 works that inspire your project.  
	•	For each one, write what you love most about it.  
	•	Identify patterns—are there common themes, structures, aesthetics that connect them?  
	•	Now ask: How do I make these elements my own?  
  
4. The Positive and Negative Pulse (Momentum in Storytelling)  
  
Stories move through contrast—positive and negative shifts keep a reader engaged.  
	•	Not good vs. evil. Instead, think of how momentum changes scene by scene.  
	•	A scene should start in one state and end in another.  
  
Scene Start	Action	Scene End  
Hopeful	Protagonist receives bad news	Desperate  
Angry	Argument turns into reconciliation	Relieved  
Confused	Discovers a clue	Determined  
  
Activity: Scene Pulse Mapping  
	1.	Write a scene where a character enters a room in one emotional state and leaves in another.  
	2.	Identify the shift (positive → negative, or vice versa).  
	3.	Rewrite the scene but reverse the emotional change (e.g., if the scene went positive → negative, try negative → positive).  
  
5. The Story Wave (Macro & Micro Structure)  
  
📈 Stories follow a wave pattern—ups and downs in tension and resolution.  
📉 Each scene also has mini-waves—little rises and falls in intensity.  
  
Activity: Graph Your Story  
	1.	Sketch a waveform and mark the high and low points of your story.  
	2.	Do the same for a single scene—where does the energy peak and dip?  
	3.	Find flat spots and adjust them to add more tension or contrast.  
  
6. Back-and-Forth Email Brainstorm  
  
Let’s email ideas back and forth to refine them.  
  
How It Works:  
	1.	You send an email with:  
	•	A rough idea.  
	•	A question or problem you’re stuck on.  
	2.	I reply with:  
	•	Suggestions, challenges, or new angles.  
	3.	You respond with a revision or new draft.  
	4.	We repeat until it feels solid.  
  
Final Takeaways  
  
✅ Stories are about change. If a character isn’t making choices, they’re stuck.  
✅ Scenes must shift. Every scene should move from one state to another.  
✅ Positive & negative pulses drive tension. Momentum is everything.  
✅ The wave structure matters. Stories rise and fall in a rhythmic way.  
✅ Exploratory writing is messy. The goal is momentum, not perfection.  
✅ Keep the conversation going. Let’s email and refine ideas together.
