Got it. Here’s a full breakdown of writing structures, along with guidance on how to analyze works he’s inspired by and how to embrace exploratory writing.  
  
1. Study What Inspires You (Reverse Engineering Narrative Structure)  
  
If he’s working on a comic, graphic novel, or any specific format, he should pick 2-3 examples that inspire him and analyze their structure.  
  
Activity: Break Down the Narrative of Works You Love  
  
For each of his chosen inspirations, he should:  
	1.	Summarize the entire plot in a paragraph.  
	2.	Break the story into key beats (e.g., major events, turning points, character shifts).  
	3.	Analyze the pacing—Where does it slow down? Where does it ramp up?  
	4.	Identify themes—What’s the core message? What ideas repeat?  
	5.	Look at dialogue vs. visuals (for comics/graphic novels)—How much is told through text vs. images?  
  
Example Breakdown for a Comic or Graphic Novel:  
	•	What happens in each panel on the first page?  
	•	What introduces conflict or tension?  
	•	How does the story visually communicate emotion or movement?  
  
By reverse-engineering, he’ll see patterns and gain a clearer sense of structure.  
  
2. Vomit Drafting as an Umbrella Mindset  
  
The Vomit Draft is a philosophy, not an activity—it’s the permission to write without judgment. The idea is:  
	•	No one will see this but you.  
	•	It’s supposed to be messy, ugly, and bad.  
	•	This is where you find the raw, unpolished ideas.  
	•	Every writer starts with shit before refining it.  
  
Activity: Give Yourself Permission to Write Badly  
	•	Set a word count goal, not a quality goal (e.g., “Write 500 words, no matter what”).  
	•	Use “I don’t know” placeholders (e.g., “Something happens here that I’ll figure out later”).  
	•	Accept that exploratory writing isn’t the final product—it includes:  
	•	Character bios  
	•	Theme exploration  
	•	Worldbuilding notes  
	•	Random dialogue ideas  
  
3. 5 Essential Story Structures  
  
Different structures fit different kinds of stories. Here are five to experiment with:  
  
A. Classic Dramatic Structure (Freytag’s Pyramid)  
  
Best for: Traditional dramas, plays, literary fiction.  
	•	Exposition – Introduce setting, characters, and stakes.  
	•	Rising Action – Introduce conflict, obstacles build tension.  
	•	Climax – The peak moment of tension (a major decision, battle, revelation).  
	•	Falling Action – Consequences of the climax unfold.  
	•	Resolution – Ties up loose ends, establishes the new normal.  
  
B. Three-Act Structure  
  
Best for: Films, comics, graphic novels, novels.  
	•	Act 1: Setup – Establish the protagonist, world, and inciting incident.  
	•	Act 2: Confrontation – The protagonist struggles, faces obstacles, and reaches a low point.  
	•	Act 3: Resolution – The final confrontation leads to a conclusion.  
  
C. The Hero’s Journey (Joseph Campbell)  
  
Best for: Epic quests, fantasy, sci-fi, coming-of-age stories.  
	1.	Ordinary World – The hero’s normal life.  
	2.	Call to Adventure – Something disrupts their world.  
	3.	Refusal of the Call – The hero resists change.  
	4.	Meeting the Mentor – Guidance appears.  
	5.	Crossing the Threshold – The hero enters the unknown.  
	6.	Tests, Allies, Enemies – Encounters that shape the journey.  
	7.	Approach to the Inmost Cave – A major challenge looms.  
	8.	The Ordeal – A moment of crisis.  
	9.	Reward (Seizing the Sword) – A breakthrough or treasure is gained.  
	10.	The Road Back – The hero returns to the ordinary world.  
	11.	Resurrection – A final test.  
	12.	Return with the Elixir – The hero brings knowledge or change back home.  
  
D. The Kishōtenketsu (Four-Act Structure)  
  
Best for: Non-Western storytelling, slice-of-life, emotional narratives.  
	1.	Ki (Introduction) – Establish characters and setting.  
	2.	Shō (Development) – Expand on the world, introduce small events.  
	3.	Ten (Twist) – A surprising event shifts the story.  
	4.	Ketsu (Conclusion) – The story resolves based on the twist.  
  
E. Nested Structure (Inception, Cloud Atlas, Rashomon)  
  
Best for: Complex, nonlinear storytelling.  
	•	A story within a story, or multiple intersecting timelines.  
	•	The structure mirrors itself (e.g., characters influencing events across different layers).  
  
4. Additional Writing Activities  
  
To help him play with structure, here are a few focused exercises:  
  
A. Rearranging Narrative Order  
	•	Take a story idea and write three versions:  
	1.	Linear version (Beginning → Middle → End)  
	2.	Reverse version (End → Middle → Beginning)  
	3.	Fragmented version (Reveal events out of order)  
	•	This teaches how structure shapes tension and emotion.  
  
B. Writing a Scene with Constraints  
	•	Write the same scene four times, but each time:  
	1.	Change the POV (First-person, third-person, omniscient).  
	2.	Change the tense (Past, present, future).  
	3.	Remove all adjectives and adverbs.  
	4.	Write only in dialogue.  
	•	This forces different ways of thinking about the same moment.  
  
C. The “What If?” Chain  
	•	Start with a single “What if?” question (e.g., “What if a man wakes up and no one remembers him?”).  
	•	Answer it, then ask another “What if?” based on that answer.  
	•	Keep going until a full story takes shape.  
  
5. Final Takeaways  
	•	Study what inspires you – Reverse-engineer stories he loves.  
	•	Don’t fear the vomit draft – No one starts with perfection.  
	•	Play with different structures – Different stories need different shapes.  
	•	Write fast, edit slow – Get ideas down first, then refine.
