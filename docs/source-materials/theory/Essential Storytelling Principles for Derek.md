Essential Storytelling Principles for Derek  
  
1. The Core of a Narrative: Change Through Antagonism  
  
A story is about a protagonist undergoing change due to an antagonistic force rising in their life.  
	•	A character must be making decisions. Every scene should involve a choice, and that choice pushes the story forward.  
	•	Conflict isn’t just fights—it’s resistance. This could be internal (doubt, fear) or external (a rival, an oppressive system, the weather).  
	•	Antagonism isn’t just “the villain.” It’s anything that forces the protagonist to struggle and grow.  
  
Activity: Find the Antagonist  
	1.	Choose a character.  
	2.	Identify what opposes them—what’s stopping them from getting what they want?  
	3.	Ask: How does this force escalate? How does the protagonist adapt?  
  
2. The Positive and Negative Pulse  
  
Every moment in a story should have a pulse—a shift in energy that moves the narrative.  
	•	Scenes aren’t just things happening; they shift in meaning.  
	•	A scene starts in one state and ends in another. (Positive → Negative, Negative → Positive)  
	•	Not good vs. evil. It’s momentum—how things get better or worse.  
  
Example of Scene Pulses  
  
Scene Start	Action	Scene End  
Hopeful	Protagonist receives bad news	Desperate  
Angry	Argument turns into reconciliation	Relieved  
Confused	Discovers a clue	Determined  
  
Activity: Scene Pulse Mapping  
	1.	Write a simple scene.  
	2.	Mark what emotional state it starts in.  
	3.	Mark how it changes by the end.  
	4.	Rewrite it with a clearer shift in pulse.  
  
3. Macro & Micro Dramatic Structure (Story as a Graph)  
  
A narrative is like a waveform—it goes up and down with positive and negative shifts over time.  
	•	Big Picture (Macro Pulse): The whole story has highs and lows.  
	•	Small Picture (Micro Pulse): Each scene also has highs and lows.  
  
Think of it like this:  
	•	One full story = multiple waves of rising and falling action.  
	•	Each scene = a mini-wave that contributes to the bigger picture.  
  
Example: The Macro and Micro Waves  
  
📈 Macro (Full Story)  
	•	Rise: Character gets a win.  
	•	Fall: They hit a roadblock.  
	•	Rise: They find hope.  
	•	Fall: It gets worse.  
	•	Climactic rise: They make the final choice.  
  
📉 Micro (One Scene)  
	•	Starts tense.  
	•	Information is revealed.  
	•	Tension gets worse.  
	•	A choice is made.  
	•	Scene ends with a shift.  
  
Activity: Graph Your Story  
	1.	Pick a story idea.  
	2.	Draw a simple wave:  
	•	Mark where things go up and where they go down.  
	•	Look for flat spots—places where the energy doesn’t shift.  
	•	Adjust so that every part of the story moves in some way.  
  
4. Back-and-Forth Email Brainstorm  
  
To help Derek refine ideas, let’s set up a structured email conversation where we can:  
	•	Bounce prompts back and forth.  
	•	Refine ideas together (what’s working, what’s missing).  
	•	Keep momentum going without pressure.  
  
How This Works  
	1.	Derek sends an email with:  
	•	A rough idea he’s exploring.  
	•	Any struggles he’s having (e.g., “I don’t know what happens next” or “My character feels flat”).  
	•	A question or prompt for feedback.  
	2.	I’ll reply with:  
	•	Possible directions, clarifications, or questions to deepen the idea.  
	•	A challenge (e.g., “Write this scene from a different POV”).  
	•	Encouragement to stay in the exploratory phase—don’t overthink yet.  
	3.	He responds with a revision or next step.  
	4.	We repeat as needed until he feels confident in his direction.  
  
This keeps things low-pressure, idea-driven, and momentum-based.  
  
Final Takeaways  
  
✅ Stories are about change. If a character isn’t making choices, they’re stuck.  
✅ Scenes must shift. Every scene should move from one state to another.  
✅ Positive & negative pulses drive tension. A story is built on rising and falling energy.  
✅ The wave structure matters. Look at how moments build and collapse in a rhythmic way.  
✅ Exploratory writing is MESSY. No one sees the first draft. Don’t judge it—just get ideas out.  
✅ Keep the conversation going. Let’s keep refining ideas through email back-and-forth.
