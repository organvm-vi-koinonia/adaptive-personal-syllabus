Transcript

, it's easy to use.

What?

Robin Hood is, like, super user friendly.

They give you all news, updates.

You could, like, see all the information about what you're bought. Clearly, where you bought it at. .

So when I was talking to John about the app, he told me to steal Robin Hood's function, like a look..

So that's what I was about to say, is that steal rob Robin Hood's old scenario, and if someone makes that for trading cards, then I think you have a winner on your hands, because that's the whole point of what I was just saying is that is that trading cards are going to most likely become an actual asset class and like quite considered by banks and financial institutions and like, like, it's going to be a real thing too..

So if you could do that for, like, Pokemon and magic and like, make some type of trading platform or data trading or data to treat these and find all these things or something like that, then I think you could make a lot of money somehow.

How blown away would you be if I was able to show you something in an hour?

That be?

That'd be crazy.

So, yeah, I was John called me randomly like a month, like after two months, he just waited me called me.

And I was like, hey, what do you have any ideas?

Like a week ago.

Oh, okay.

You have any ideas?

And blah, he told me the idea and then by the night he sended him stuff.

But I was, of course, he's a dickhead and he's like, no, I'm not going to, we can't get funding.

And you'll only get 30% of it because it's my idea.

And I'm like, that's the reverse, you idiot.

Like, you don't get money for having an idea.

Everyone has fucking ideas.

So I was like, I'm like, oh shit, am I about to Mark Zuckerberg him and pretend I'm making him an app, but I'm really making me an app?

I knew I saw the social network for a reason.

That must mean to me that he's, like, a little strum up right now.

Why?

He's like I need money.

Yeah, why else would you retreat to the middle of the woods?

Yeah.

Have you talked to him now?

No, he never answered me..

He told me that when he was going upstate that he's basically like, like, not talk to anyone ever again.

Yeah.

But anyway, sorry.

I want to talk about what you want to talk like, your idea anyway, I just just want to.

I just like, it's funny.

Yeah, so, no, because he's right, because Robin Hood is like, Robin Hunt's the best app, like, user-wise, but it's not the best app for, like, other reasons, like, that's why why other people use, like, Charles Klob and stuff.

So, like, if you could, but if you can make an app that's kind of like Robin Hood or porn, like, just make an account, just so you can see it, make a gol watch list, you know what I mean?

Like, you don't even need to put money into it.

I would just make an account so you could get on the app and, like, make a watch list and just, like, you know, get familiar with the app for a few days and the same thing with Co Day, make an account. .

You don't think it should be stylized?

I mean, I have my own coin, but I do have a coin base.

Oh, okay, yeah.

And I had Exodus.

I had Exodus.

I don't know.

Exod is a wallet, though.

It's not a.

But the thing is like, with coin based and stuff like, I don't think it does.

Like, it doesn't tell you the nudes about the coins and shit like that, what I mean?

Like, it't tell you what's going on.

Like, Schw, like when you you scroll down, it'll have like a news sche about like, the most important things about the Sox.

And like, that helps you , like, see why the price is swing, if it's swinging or whatever, you know what I mean?

So, if you can do something like that for the cards, where there's like a news update, like, oh, these magic cards just got banned.

Like, since these seven cards just got banned, here's the seven cards that are similar to them that people areing can be fish on and start buying.

Like, you know what I mean?

Like, if you could get, like predictive data based off like, what's going on in these card games and the, and like the sales and like the hype of these cards and and, like, things like that, and like like, the older people do buyouts on old cards all the time.

Like all of a sudden, like, you'll see, like some will buy every single maxim rule for magic that exists on the market, so that they own all of them. Make the price that they want.

So, like, there are like very, there are like sophisticated investors that do things on these platforms, like, like big buyouts and spend, like tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

So, like, let's say you facilitate $100,000 buyout of a single card , and you got 1% of that.

That would still be builted for it.

You know what I mean?

You got 3% of that.

How much do the markets make?

About that percent one, two, three?

I don't have no idea.

I have no clue.

They charge fees for transactions, but bides, I don't know.

Yeah, I mean, I just exchanged for 50 bucks, and I got, like, 40, so. .

Yeah.

So.

But yeah, but but yeah, I mean, people have in the trading card markets, more Polish than said of that.

Pokémon is out of control right now.

The price is on it.

Magic to like, the Final Fantasy boxes, I bought mine for $739 , and that shit just came out, there are 1,300 box now, already.

Damn.

People are spending $30,000 on the Troobos.

You know, it's $50,000 on the Tro.

Seriously, like the sole data of it.

And then if you look at the other cards, like the popular ones, there's like, 20, 50, 100 sales a day per card, depending on the card, you know what I mean?

So you're talking about thousands of sales per day and the hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands of dollars on range.

So you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars moving through this market every day, and that's just TCB player.

I don't know about parkinging, E with those sales.

I just look at people.

I watch YouTube videos about people looking at TCD players.

And The only Patreon I ever subscribe to that I subscribe to right now is called Out the Investments, because it's a guy who used to be a stock trader from Erill Lynch .

He cashed out, and he put all his money into cards, and he bought a million dollars at Adro stock.

And he put all the rest of his money in the cards.

So he looks at it everything like the way a stock trader would..

And YouTube videos.

He's the only patient I have because he also sells you magic directly.

Whoa.

So I I these very ind like technical videos about.

It's..

You know what that made me?

Just realize that what he's doing, in a way, who's my interpretation of it, is like, he's investing Okay, so when you invest in stocks you're investing in enough, like it's an empty prom, it's like an empty thing.

It's an empty sentiment.

When you invest in a card, you're investing in nostalgia or like something that is .

Yeah, wow.

Wow, that's interesting.

Because that's what the NFTs were trying to do in a sense.

Like, have it be worth something beyond just the thing itself.

You know?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Interesting.

And this guy has millions of dollars worth worth of products and warehouses in Florida.

I buy for him now, because every month, if you join his Patreon, he'll sell you cheap cheap magic boxes, and you can buy it for six a month.

And it's like, shit, you can't get anywhere else, because he has like, who most of them after they get, you know, like after the set runs out, the wizard doesn't reprint them.

So it's just whatever the supply there is, and he buys a shit over the supply.

He says said he's responsible for one to 10% of Wizards of the Coast total gross sales, like the entire corporation.

He's 2% of their sales.

And then he resell everything to his Patreons at discount of prices, because he gets a cheap, because he buys it in such bulk.

Wow.

But anyway, he puts up YouTube videos, and I didn't just join his paper on, like, you know, like, like I said, I' never had a patronon account.

I've been, but I've been watching him on YouTube for, like five or six years.

So, like, I knew he was legit at that point.

Like, you know, like, and he puts out these videos of like.

Des I just go very in depth about it all.

Oh, wow.

So .

What do you think would be um visually, how would it look?

Like, obviouslyviously we know the functions we want, but do you think it should be like stylized, like cards?

Like, it should be like geeky, like nerdy?

Yeah, it should be nerdy.

Yeah, definitely.

Yeah, that's the thing too. , so that kids can get on it, you know what I mean?

In a way?

Because like, not kids, but, like, uh.

Yeah, because like 18 year old stuff like that, yeah.

Yeah.

I would say like if you make it for like 14 to 45 year olds, you know what I mean?

Like 14 to 50 year olds like .

That's like the target.

Like I would say, but more generally like 14 to 40.

You know, so like Pokemon shit, old school video game shit.

Wow.

Okay, cool..

Yo, there's a lot of money in this right now.

I'm telling you, this market's more Polish than then.

And you think there's probably no one doing it, right?

Like, honestly.

Not like this.

And that doesn't matter, because you could always do it different.

Like, you know, you could always do it different, but if it's if it's truly unique, that's fucking cool.

Yeah, like, TCD play a kind of tries.

Like, they'll give you, like, a little bit of sales data on, like, on a side table, but it's nothing, like.

It's, like, it's kind of confusing.

That's why people make YouTube videos about TCG player, 'cause, like, it's a little confusing, you have to know where to click and to look around and how to, like, you know, understand, like, the actual data of it and and not just, like, you know.

So, like, I watched that, too.

I went on YouTube videos about people explaining price on T shoot cards on TCG player.

Like, there's like a whole market and an audience for this.

And it's not a little bit of money.

It's a lot of money.

It's people pumping a lot of money into this.

So..

Oh, let's let's think like, what other functions.

Okay, so imagine this thing exists, what other functions would you want to see in it that would make it like, cool and stand out and like fun?

I want to show like, all right, so say I typed in, let's let's just say separate card.

Yeah.

We all know who that is.

So say I typed in Separate one wing angel.

I want to see a picture of a card.

I want to see all the other variations of the card.

I want to know if there's a borderless version, because that's what's hard to find when you' searching the pricerices.

You gotta type in the very specific, is it borderless?

Is it colar?

Is it search foil?

Is it, you gotta know what you're looking for, but typing in.

So if you do type it in and one thing pull up, and it'll have every variation of the card, the actual, regular card, the the special art variant, the borderless variant, you know, the chase serialized line.

It tells you every version of the card of that available , and then you can just click on that card on your phone, and then it tells you the sales data underneath it for that.

What's done for now, the average shipping price, the most recently sold, you know what I mean?

And then if you buy it, then you should have that underneath that, what you bought it for, , you know, how the price has gone up and down, like a stock would, just like Charles Schwz would show you, like, Screenshot my Charles Schwab, so you can see what it looks like.

What about..

Yeah, I can keep it on, please, Dad.

And then it should that you should have a way to link that to your bank account or your PayPal or something, too.

So this way you't have this way you can just directly be involved with the exchange, which I guess is the way you would make money.

Well, okay, so what I was going to ask you is, like, what about in what ways could it be a community app, like something for people to chat in and meet in and mark, you know, talking?

Place to find Well, you'd have to create that, I guess.

You could make like a you know, a forum page, a discord page.

You could just make like a No, we want No, because I'm thinking like, uh, okay, so one of the functions from that crypto app that I thought really stood out to me anyway, because I's it's Okay, let me look it up with them.

It's the ways of like taking the people who make the most money and giving them like, uh, uh, what is it?

Like you give them their own own page and they're like the, and you could follow them and you could follow their tips and shit.

Patron, do you have any Patreons?

I do, yeah.

So kind of like Patreon.

Like when you're on someone's Patreon page shows you other people who subscribe to this person's Patreon, who else, stay subscribe to.

You know, there is, like you comment on any post on Patreon.

Oh, hey. Shit like that.

So that's what you should do that.

You should combine Patreon, Robin Hood, and like, and the coinbased into like one app and then then like integrate the TCG player, Clark Kingdom and eBay data.

And if you if you could make like something like that, I think you have like a real real something to unhand it.

Okay.

I mean, we'd share it out.

We'd share it.

But yes, for sure.

Do you have you have any What happened?

You broke up there.

What are you say?

Sorry?

Let me you.

Let me tell you.

All right.

I'll tell you back. .

I'm sorry.

I'm giving someone else attention other than you for five minutes.

Um..

But what were you getting at at that last bit?

Because you were talking about how we could make it more, like, fun or, you know, just , you know.

Make it look like Patreon and stuff.

You know what I mean?

It's like you with people and join a community and directly talk to, because like, make it so it's easy to directly book to the person that's holding the card.

Like, all these all these, um, I guess specific besides eBay, where you can message people, like, all these other apps, like, you don't know who the seller is.

You can't talk to the seller, really.

You could try to contact them through, like, if you Google the business name, I guess, at their business name, you know, if they're like, if they're like, you know, Krypton comics is the seller.

I guess you could Google them and like put them up and try to call them.

But like, besides that, there's no easy way to reach them.

Like, if you have a direct message button on it and you could just start talking to them, I think that would be a good thing too.

Yeah, no, that is cool.

That's a cool one.

What about if you could, so I'm going to send you this app.

It's called Habetica.

It's like a gamified RPG, but for tasks.

And you get like different, you get to basically, you get armor and you get different like access accessories.

And I was always like hoping it would have a actual battles animation.

Like, it looks like it's gearing up for you to actually have a game.

And it would be cool if maybe I like the style.

I wonder if you'd like the style for the like if you think the style would fit the app.

Yeah, something like that.

Yeah.

Because then you get your own little avatar, you know what I mean?

Yeah, if you could integ something like that would .

Because that's what I'm doing.

So I did I was talking to Rob, and he's like, no, I don't want to even think about it.

I'd be too overloaded.

I'm like,ro, I'm not even doing it for you.

I'm really doing it for me.

So up.

You don't want to what?

I was like, oh, if you could have your own fitness app, what would it be?

He's like, I don't even want to think about it because it'd be overloading.

I'm like, first off, it's not even really for you.

It's for me, but Tekov.

Just answer the fucking questions.

I'm being annoying, retarded.

And so anyway, I did my own I did my own deep dive.

You only has so much bandwidth.

Yeah, I know.

That's why I did my own deep dive on him and I was like, oh, he should have a video.

He likes games and fitness.

His fitness thing, his whole thing should be a video game, like his whole portal and his whole thing, because that's that would just be a cool element for him, you know?

And so I'd started designing this whole thing for him.

And anyway, yeah.

No, so same thing.

Like this is cool that we'reumbling into this. That reminds me of I've been doing Duoo for the past two months.

And, you know, they make it like a game and they give you, you know, like a level and experience and you and then you, you make, you know, like, say like, I have them on Jessica's family plan.

So like, we're all friends on it , and like, you have to, you like, do like challenges with with each other and like, quests, like not to break the Daily streak and you get like different bonuses for XK boos and they have like different leagues based on all those lingo players and you move up in leagues and you have the most XP, like I'm in one of the higher leagues right now because I get a lot of XP every .

Yeah, I haven't played it in since I was like five years ago, but I remember really enjoying it.

It makes you like very, it makes you want to return to it, not even to learn the language, just to play.

Yeah, and I just had a trust too, which is what her dad's doing. .

And it's a lot of fun.

Like it gets like addictive, you know what I mean?

It gets like any other game in a way.

You know?

And like, I do it personally because, like, I want to communicate with a family, but also, you know her brother in law that I don't like.

I because it's my brother-in-law.

Mr. Zitt sneakies in?

Yeah, and Mr. Sneakies in?

It's no Spanish.

Like, you know what I mean, like, a little bit.

Like, Jessica's she was like, I don't I should know more, to be honest..

But, um so they started on level 14.

I think Justice started on level, like, 13 and her sister started on 14, or like something like that, or like, 12 and 133., they started that, like, 'cause it assesses how good you are in the beginning.

And he started at 14, too.

And we were all like, like, where he's He's always swiping.

No swiper.

Yeah, like, does this Spanish?

And we all like questioning.

We thought he was cheating.

And just being like the Italian I knew, I started at like a six, which wasn't bad.

I started like a six or seven or something .

And I've worked my way to 1, but my point telling you this is that, like, it became the thing.

Like, the inside joke for like, me and Jessica and stuff to beat Will.

And I asked them that it listen on my, you said, from working in the projects and his coworkers, he picked all that up.

So I was like, all right, I got I guess that makes sense, you. , like I asked him, you take in high school?

He was like, "No.

So, I didn't have a follow question, I just thought I was going the answer.

And I was like, "O. And then he was like, and then I asked him, I was like, did you.

I just stressed out, like, how did you get so high on Duol?

Are you like,oo it?

A joke, and he was like, "No, like, from the precinct, I just learned it."

And I was like, "..

So is he essentially just a liar or he's not like, he's...

Nobody seems to know it.

He can get every week.

That was my point is that now it's like an inside joke between like me just assist that. Like I try to beat Will.

You know what I mean?

I'm trying to pass Will and level and in Spanish and stuff.

You know what I mean?

So like, you know, it became like another little mini game, you know what I mean?

Like in another self.

So now you guys don't only play..

Community-based.

So, do you still sneak his ends?

Yeah, I do, still, yeah.

Does he do.

I stopped for a while, but I fell back in.

Yeah, well, yeah, he was sneaky.

I went there for the baby gender reveal, and But then I was like, I told I stopped vaping, like, were eating and all that?

Yeah.

So it was like, it was like day two or three of like me not vaping.

So we was sitting there and like, I was getting, I was just so bored.

Like, I had a drink or two, I was like, well. You't I'm like, I didn't give a fuck at that point.

I did I find everybody.

He was like, yeah, yeah.

I was like, I was like, I need to do right now.

I was like, I was like, I'm stressing.

I'm not ving shit.

I was like, I need to eat an edible on the car right here or nothing.

I was like, I need a fucking gun right now.

She's like, all right.

Oh, my God.

What is with that?

Like, I think a lot of us, we do it unintentionally, but we turn our partner into our parent, and that's, you know, I'm sure they don't want to be.

You know what I mean?

I'm sure they're not like. You know, I don't know.

I feel like it's it's an unwanted roleole.

But I think we always we need someone in our life to not get to feel like we have to not get in trouble or something.

Yeah, I mean, I think it's I mean I know what you're saying, but yeah I mean he's just just like so, like.

No, because I do it with Madison.

I always, whenever I'm in a relationship, I do the same thing.

I'm like, oh, I can't tell them this, I can't tell them that.

It's like, well, who cares?

It just be your own person, but yeah, we do you say?

Sorry.

Yeah, yeah.

No, no, no.

It's just, no, no, I don't know.

I was going to say is that she is just as like, so, like, she never, like, did anything like that.

You know what I mean?

Like, she never smoked, never vapes, she never did anything.

So, like, just to her, anything is something, you know what I mean?

So it like.

Then what's her outlet for, like, freaking out?

When she's freaking out? .

Shopping, foods.

Um, Shop she just gets really depressed sometimes and just, like freaks out for a few days, I guess.

But, yeah, I mean, I guess. Those are the worst.

Those are the ones that are going to kill you in your sleep.

Yeah.

Like Tenenbaum.

Yeah, yeah.

I mean, she definitely goes through that, but, like, I guess what is her, like, outlet?

I mean, I mean, she does, you know, she'll she'll do outibles of me now.

You know, she gets, like, the drinks.

She'll smoke, she'll smoke some flour with me now.

You know, like, And it's been long enough now that you're she's not really phoning it in.

She actually must like it.

Yeah, yeah, she does.

She does.

She does.

She gets worried that she's, like, getting addicted like, you know, silly amounts..

Oh, so look at this.

So, I sent this.

So the other night, I was talking to Rachel in the kitchen, and she's been getting this dog calendar for since we were kids .

And so I was like, oh, let me just turn that, let me just take a practice and turn that into an app.

And I did that.

And I just sent it to you.

And I was like, and then so me and her started talking about how we could make it even cooler, like, more unique.

And I was like, oh shit, this is this is sick.

So like, then it gave me the idea to just start asking everyone I know about something they might be interesting in or like that would be cool if it was an app.

And then this is just a way for me to build my own portfolio, you know, of different things that I could do.

Yeah.

It's silly, but it's cool.

Like, I think it's fun.

And I'm gonna make it better.

It's just a prototype, but...

So you see where I sent you like the first screenshot where it says Equities?

And then it starts ling stocks?

Let me see.

Yeah, yes.

So if you can do something like that where it just tells you like the card, you know what I mean?

Like the first one be like.

I, you know, whatever, a bronze Dragon, but third one to be, whatever.

And then try to be like, you know, you know, like your game, like, you not like that.

You mark the value changes, your total game gets the day , you know.

So it would be cool.

It would be cool if the card was like generated, right, based on some, like if it had like different generation, you know, qualities.

Like maybe it was personalized like you, or maybe it's like just a new Sepheroth version or whoever the card is, it could be generative, like with AI.

What do you mean?

So, I'm trying to imagine what this equity thing would look like, but if you clicked on it, gad, please.

Yeah.

No, you're playing.

That's Yes.

That's like when you's scroll it keeps showing you like, how much of it's being treated all the time, then tells you the news about it, like by the day.

And then it tells you like rings and records is what you were saying, like, you know, if it'sish or garish and the predicted things.

What if it looked like a character sheet, though?

Like, what if it looked like a character sheet?

No, that's you gotta get creative.

Cool.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah, yeah.

But there's nothing like for, is what I'm saying.

Like they only have it for stocks and crypto and all that.

So the whole thing is that if cards are actually becoming an asset class, like the news is saying they are, like real places, like Forbes and you know, all that. Type of shit, then, you know, I feel like the best one, the best it doesn't have to be the first, but the best one to make something like that is going to be a winner.

No, it sounds, you know, wild.

You know, frankly, it's like, I'm it sounds more interesting than, you know, when John pitched me his thing , I was like, oh, okay, this sounds kind of cool, then it reminded you of Mike Bacosi and him selling his thing and I did all this research on that.

But I'm like, oh, crypto's so whatever.

It's so boring even to mention it.

It's boring.

And this is more in our, my, you know, lanes.

So I feel like I can make it fun and cool.

I don't.

But you can make it fun and cool and like a game and you have all that knowledge.

That's what I'm saying.

Like we could gamify it, like it make it fun and make it community-based and so on and so forth.

That would make it cool, you know?

Look at you.

As much, you know what we should do when we hang up if you have anything you can think of, do a dump on me right now, 'cause I'm gonna compile all this info, and I'm gonna come up with a prototype tonight.

I'm like interested in, so I'm gonna do a tonight, I want to delay working on what I've been working on, which is driving me crazy.

I'm trying to automate all my dad's systems and stuff, like all of his software.

I'm trying to automate all my dad's data and systems, so, he doesn't have to do any.

So basically, you could take all of your Microsoft 360s , dump it into a processing software thing that is on the back end of Microsoft, and you could start automating all the tasks so you don't have to do them anymore.

So I'm trying to set that up for my dad.

It's going to be wild.

That's actually.

It's going to be really cool.

That's cool.

I want you.

Yeah, the timing of this couldn't have been better.

That's good.iming is not.

I want to show you something right now.

Please.

And put it on put it on the bank.

Did you It's not loading.

Give me a second.

Let me try another browser.

I'll just send you a train.

Is Pokémon becoming an asset?

According to block apps , cool .

And the fact that it's.

Dude, I could, if this is really, you know, it could literally build this in a few weeks, like, if it's that imperative, you know?

Like.

Yeah.

It says the PCD market exceeds $10 billion. That's a big money.

And now it would be interesting to figure out out of that 10 billion how many people are over 18 and could trade.

Wow.

Interesting.

That's coming from.

It's from kids that now have money.

You know, people like you and I that now have money and spend on this.

Wow, this is cool.

The first thing in Lincoln I see how trading became a $5 million But anyway, I want to show you this video real quick.

'Cause this is the guy I was talking about, who's I'ard just put the most relevant video to the conversation that we could have asked for. .

Hold on.

Quick with me.

I' I'm gonna keep you in, but I'm gonna you I'm sort of something if you talk, I'll hear it.

I'm gonna pass this video in the.

Oh, then why don't you FaceTime me and put a screen share?

I'm taking.

Oh, um I'll do it.

I'm going to do it, watch, and then you can just share your screen.

All right Just wait a second.

Yo., hold on.

So this is the guy who's Patreon.

I subscribe to that I was telling you about the Florida man.

He's a fella man.

You see had a share on there up there?

Yeah, yeah.

Are you seeing that?

It?

Not yet.

What are you saying?

Shit.

Soon.

It's almost doing it.

Go ahead, try and. That You probably have to stay on the screen, yeah.

Yeah, I think I fucked up.

Is it working?

I could pull it up if you not get it. .

Oh, choose you.

Okay.

All right, now, I think it's working.

Three, two, one.

I'm .

Yep.

You see it out?

Yep.

All right.

Do you have one?

All right, folks.

Yep, got it.

One Florida man's journey to navigate an entire life.

Look the name of the veil, you're witnessing his 37. .

Can you make it a little louder?

I think you're controlling it, the volume. Was trouble.

We made it to the second half of nothing short of an absolutely historical year for collectingibles and car games.

There's no other words or anything I can describe to you , besides a simple, historical time to be in the card word industry.

I've been doing this my entire life.

How long have I been on YouTube?

I've been on YouTube for 10 years, and I assure you all.

I have never seen . Market conditions like this.

By far, I think we can all agree now you're seeing spillover from the Poke Bros P chers into magic.

That's a pretty confirmed thing..

Is magic Also, it going to be an is an asset or no?

No.

It's over 30 years old, so.

That's That's the one thing I need is like the one criteria. Besides like marching passing market behaviors.

And I want to discuss with you what I think is a concern w is interesting and what I think we're getting ready to walk into.

We don't have to watch this whole thing.

It's just like funny that it happened this way, right?

Yeah, but I think that just backs up, but I was just like, you pretty good.

And that's the guy I was talking about who has a million.ions and millions of dollars to this.

Damn, bro.

Like, how much money .

So does he have any stake in making it fake or phony?

Like, you don't think that, right?

Like, I buy I bought a F .

I said, he sold it to me now he's for, so he and sat on him and let him go up, but he appreciates his bankon subscribers and he that's the point of paying $50,000 pay because he access to cheap that's difficult to find in the first place.

Interesting.

Okay.

Hmm.

It's 's that type of stuff.

You know what I mean?

Like, yeah, you're paying a membership fee, but then you also have access to products that other people don't have, and you haven't access to them at this .

Oh.

Okay.

Interesting, okay.

Hmm.

So, as you think of things, you know, if there's any other links, anything you want me to look at, any inspiration, because the way it works, like the way I'm finding it to work is the more data I have, the more .

The more.

I come more could come up with interesting stuff, basically.

How do we get out of this?

Yeah.

Of course.

I don't .

No, you mean.

You know what I mean?

Like, if, hmm, how do I have to describe it best?

You know, like, it's like when you do research, right, you, you want to fold, like like I should show you all the documents I drafted without even making an app, right?

Like, because what you could do is you could do a deep research and it'll research for like 10 minutes and it pull it goes through 100, 200 sources and it creates this really sick, like a document.

You know, you could point it anywhere you want, but I'll do like a market gap, basically, which is like, what are these other apps doing that, that, yeah, what are these apps doing and not doing?

And then where do we have room for something interesting in our app, basically?

Okay.

Does that make sense?

Yeah.

Let's get out of the screen share.Cause I can't hear you as much anymore.

Okay.

No matter?

Yeah.

No, that makes sense?

Um.

What are you doing for the.

Is Jessica coming back tonight?

No, that's I' picked her up tomorrow after .

I just want to show you one more thing before we go.

I'm not in a Russian.

Yeah, I guess that's really my best idea I got for you, of the opportunity that I see that I don't have the knowledge or time to construct, but definitely not the knowledge.

Oh, hold on.

She's calling me.

Let me play her.

Yeah, no worries. A little bit.

I waiting for the new donkey .

Nothing launched on it that was that exciting, right?

No, yeah, I Street Fighter again, but I already had it just like, it, I could play Mob, I guess. .

I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos of this guy called, the Wi F. Like, Jesse James and like, I mean, Jesse Jordan, or whatever his name is, like, it's like a lot of weird, like, conspiracy type stuff.

I haven't nothing really caught my attention.

I watched a few episodes of Cyberpunk with Rocco.

I'cause I never saw it.

And I really liked that.

Oh, yeah, I love that.

I was going to say, you didn't like that?

I was going to be surprised.

No, yeah, I just haven't been spending time watching TV.

I watched the White Lotus.

That was good, but...

It's just like, when you're living with other people, you just feel like I feel like I always have to be like, busy, you know what I mean?

I don't want to be lounging too much.

Yeah.

You rolling up?

Yeah.rupted me in the middle. .

You threw off my groove. You.

Have you seen a Buff?

No, I've been talking with him a little bit.

Doc's actually texted me today, too.

Because I go to my comics back and find me.

It just takes a decade.

Yeah, it took forever.

He's like, being real weird about it too.

Like he wouldn't let me, like pull up to his house to get them. .

What is wrong with him?

I don't know.

He'd like box him bring him to me. .

Oh, you Do you know what John at his apartment, by the way?

Like, did he just just What he did with that?

He didn't go into detail, and he's like, and you're going to you know, what did he say?

Don't ask any questions.

Don't ask any questions.

Why?

Because you're because.

It's not because you're doing anything cool.

It's because you want the mystery because you're doing some white trash shit.

Like, let's be real here. .

I don't know..

I would have tuck it if you would have said something.

Yeah, like, what an idiot, honestly.

Like, I would have loved that.

But anyway. ...

It's kind of.

Oh, yeah, so he hit me up and he's like, uh.

He's like, hey, he goes some South docs.

He's like, I'm selling my N64.

So I figured I'd give you the first track.

I was like, yeah, please, just let me know what you want for it.

He's like, end the game.

So I was like, yeah, send the game.

Times are tough.

I It's just hard, like.

But the thing is, like, oh, times are tough for everyone, so, enough..

Like, you My grandfather said it to me when I was home.

He's like, he wasn't even saying it about me.

He was just saying like, you, I have plenty to complain about.

Do you see me complaining?

Like, no, but you're a miserable prick in general, so you hold it in, I guess.

I haven't heard from Gabe in a long time.

Oh, really?

Yeah, what about you?

Yeah, that was the last time I heard from him, too.

What do they call them the Gyms in Pokémon?

G something or something Jim?

No, just. Trainer?

I don't know.

There's g .

They don't call it Brock Jim.

Jim Leaf Jim and Rock.

Okay, okay.

That's's like the bad, not like the g..

You got a rock.

Because I'm thinking of Rob's like animated website as like a gym, you know, a Pokemon gym.

Rock gym.

That's how cool that.

For now.

So you remember, like a few when I was kind of trying to explain to you, like the project I was working on with ChatCBT, like with the myth and myths and all that.

And we were like, oh, it's so, you know, it's kind of so hard to it's like very complicated.

I don't even know what you're talking about.

Well, now that Gemini and all these apps came out, that let you prototype stuff really quick, I could literally take an idea and make it within a few minutes, like an hour or two.

And it like, it just literally changed the game for me.

Like, I feel like I could literally do almost anything now.

Like, it's pretty cool.

Like, I was talking to Nicholas before he called me because he took too many edibles, and he was like, I can't move.

I'm like, okay, I'm going to turn that into a game right now, and I literally just turned it into a game and sent it to him. .

Because he has a dog, so I wrote,kay, I took too many edibles and my dog has to go out to pee, but I have to work up the energy to get off the couch.

How could I do that?

And it turned into a little game.

Let me see, can we view this?

Yes!

Nice.

Okay, kind of works.

Okay.

Okay, I'm gonna send you just the old version of it, but I worked out like a bunch of different ways to make the design cooler and more 3D and all that stuff, but let me show you this.

For us.

So, you said there's other games like when I brought up, a tabletop companion app, like something where, I don't know, like it animated what you were playing or kept score or, I don't know, something like..

Well, I know people are doing that for like D&D and .

And like the games they have shit like that direct themselves you know what I mean?

There's a magic app or whatever.

We're ready.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And the ones that I was using for the that they go taken down the serviceert.

Even Evercest, the major Evercrest amalation service just got taken down, like to the biggest one.

And then the one that I was on, I don't know if you remember, I downloaded the Priv Sver ever across the community and joined it a few months ago.

And I'm glad I didn't put that much time into it' because they told their private service, too, and being taken Oh, really?

Ooh, well, this would be a quick way to do what I was thinking.

One of my one of the functions of the app that I'm thinking of, you know, is it's basically all it's a few IPs that you would like, that you could combine, and they would like fuse like, you know, Drable Z characters. And then it would print cards of them and then you could play, you know, your own game out of that.

So everyone would have their own.

Yeah, good.

Yeah, you can make a taxi generator.

Exactly.

Like, oh, um, so everything in the public domain is legal to use.

And then you could use Goku if he's fused with, I don't know, Santa, that's not..

You should look at .

Pokey Rog. Looked that up.

I shit that no one ever before.

You know what I mean?

They have like their own, but like it's mostly the real ones.

If it's like all the real ones that ever exist and it's like a device .

Oh, shit.

And it's not a Poke game.

It's not a game, it's been for a long time, I don't't been yet.

It's still active.

Yeah, cool.

Yeah, it's It already, but like it with a lot of people.

But yeah, like, that's like what you're talking about, like they have their own, like you.

Oh, dude, it's an HTM.

It's a game that loads in your browser?

Yeah, bro.

People play at all day. Just all day.

I'm like, sitting here click Oh, my God, if I could fucking wow.

That's cool.

That's a massively big game.

Holy shit.

Yeah, it peaked already, but it was massively.

How do you think they made money?

I Look at that link I sent you really quick.

So when John was Kwame told me he's he has someone from India doing his his website, so he said, "Oh, I found it, I found the site he made you."

Wait, so what is this Gemini.

Google like?

It's's the appa used to generate the stuff.

It says hello, John?

No, wait.

You don't see you don't see that?

It says hello, John?

No.

No, it's not show that.

It says hello, John.

Really?

No, I'm me try again.

I'm try again.

I think I. You might to clicked the wrong thing because it says. .

It's just like loading it for me.

It's like loading Google G. Oh, maybe the link expired.

Wait, let me hold on. Comes up again because I saw it when you hold it up.

Uh.

Let's see if it works.

Yeah, it'sing..

So that's how quick I made it.

He told me he had an Indian dude making it, and I went, oh, oh, I just found it I just saw he put it up for you, and I sent him this.

Welcome to Gemini.

It's because I don't have this, that's what I'm serious.

So the guy did it in Indian?

No, that was the joke.

I'm saying that.

You know, remember in Silicon Valley, they always made the Asian version of it?

No, I didn't watch that.

So they like, steal all the American' ideas and they do an Asian version?

So as he was telling me, they're like, oh, he stole your.

I said, take this website and make it into Hindi.

That was funny.

Oh, man..

Pokey Rogue.

That's cool, dude.

I didn't realize that.

That was so.

Wow.

I'm gonna steal this right now. People.

Ooh, I bet there's Yeah, yeah, sorry.

That's like a whole community, you know what I mean People.

I was gonna say, is there there's probably a gitub, which has all the documents ready?

I could just literally steal it and put my own thing on top of it?

Probably.

Hell yeah.

Yeah, if you could do that with characters and like, that'd be suck.

Wow.

I played it for a little bit.

It got too hard.

It got difficult.

I It's a hard game?

Wow.

Yeah, when you die, you die start over it's like games.

Yeah.

I don't know how to describe them .

Like.

See, this is why you have to talk to people, because you get all these ideas that you don't even realize, you know.

It's like.

Yeah.

I would have never known about Pokey Rogue.

Yeah, you want to see I got made lucky yesterday.

You want to see what I pulled?

I like, I went to the mall at my break, the men the mall.

And .

You hear the store.

Yes, yeah.

Yeah.

They have packs.

And they had like 17 packs, so I bought them all.

I'm gonna get those on my finger I don't want to touch you with this fucking Wow, this is fucking crazy.

And you said your boy plays, um Rcape, right?

Oh, he's one of the most famous players.

I'm not kidding.

Is that that game that game's very light on coding, too., right?

But it's very .

I mean, they updated it.

They updated.

I don't, I don't know.

I mean, it's a really old game, so I guess like the original throw it is like. They't they didn't just leave it alone for 10 years. , I show you the best mans, you so lucky.

And that's the foil one with the number behind.

That's like the the hardest one they got.

It's really nice quality.

Yeah.

Ooh, I have a good question for you.

Would there be a way to, so let's say we have have a game that it makes original characters and would there be a way to print cards on demand?

It's pretty good done.

Yeah, I mean I'm sure way to get done.

If Rick fucking Glassman could do it.

Yes.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

Yes, okay, cool.

So this is like 125.

About 25?

Yeah, $125.

Damn.

I didn't have one.

Nice.

That's6 bucks or so.

I don't know if you remember the little black mage from Fasy 9 He's like 60 bucks.

And then I pulled like the main arch from the first game before. .

Ooh, that's cool.

Yeah, it's got the old school fucking80s art.

Wait, let me see it again.

Oh, wow, I like that.

It doesn't have the boundaries or container. .

So, how big is the Final Fantasy deck?

What'd you guess?

I'm sorry, how big is the..

I'm trying to imagine how many cards you would need in a card game to play.

Oh, oh, 60.

0.

Or Commander.

There's two different performance that people play.

Stand commander. 60 command 100.

Chris what Pokemon came out at 150, and then it had these auxiliary cards, right?

All these items and this, that, and the other thing.

I wonder that, how many cards would make a game, you know, basically?

Oh, well, yeah, usually60 decks or 200 decks.

I got.

So they're oh, they're magic based and it's just so magic has these. Gat crossover with fantasy is so huge.

So .

Does magic do that with other IPs as well?

They just started doing that like the past year or two, that's why the market's getting flooded with so much new money.

And that's why all the P people are looking at it now, because they're like, oh, we can't even buy Pokemon products because the second it has a target shelter is 18 people having a fishf over them to go resell them for four times the price, the packs. They didn't just start, but within the past two or three years, they just ramp it up. In time.

Okay, so now imagine fucking them people doing spotlights with us.

This app could do spotlights too, right?

Like You can make your own, yeah.

That's I meant meant by proxies.

That's why I meant I said you could make cool proxies.

That's what I meant, is that you could take existing magic cards , like, say I have a time warp card.

I then you could make it.

So you have your Greek mythology shit.

The card will still be time warp and functions, like, you know what I mean?

Play to mana, you know, whatever the card does.

But instead of it being the time warp art and everything, you can make it, you know, whatever.

Oh, shit.

And I can't think of a mythological reference for that.

You can make it, I don't know.

No, I know what you're saying, though, yeah, like, um..

You resk it something like Totally.

That. A sense..

So, are there any other, like, DVs the only fusion based mythology that I know?

Do you know any other fusion based mythologies?

Like, where they Or you know, I mean, you know what I'm saying?

What do they call that?

It's not called mythology and everything, but it's called.

Arcana?

No.

Like lore?

Lore, yeah.

Are there any other lores that have fusion?

People are fusing?

Yeah. .

C in myths, everyone that people transform, but they don't fuse, and then anyway, it doesn't really matter.

It's just a cool function, because there's different types of fusions, and I don't even realize it.

You know, there's absorption where you you take them in and you take, you know, like you eat them or you literally fuse.

It's cool that DBZ did that and I don't really see that in anything else.

Actually, let me look that up.

You should watch the new the new the new fucking one that came out, it was good.

It was like very old school Dragon World that had, like a lot of cool shit like that.

Like, they got into, like, the demon world, like, they're in the demon world the whole time.

And, like, they introduced a lot of lore, like, with them.

It was Dima, D. Fusions and transfer maps. , obviously, they like evolve with stones and they transform ..

So I'm gonna share my screen so you can see what I'm doing here.

Yo, you know what's a good idea?

What?

Can you hear?

Yeah, I'm trying to.

Do remember the game Monster Rancher?

No.

They still make them, I think.

But, so it was a PS1 game. .

It was a PS1 game, and it was like basically like Pokemon, but the way you got your monster is was that you'd have to think a different disk and put it in your PS1, the PS1 would read the disk and then generate a monster based off like whatever they would read.

So, like. Maybe you could maybe you could I don't know.

No, keep going. Yeah. Incorporate that into the game, I'm saying, but like, you do something, you unlock some type of clothes, and it generates like, you know, like Py Rogue.

It makes like a different type of, like, you would need, like some type of AIR generating these things, I guess, but, like, it makes some type of unique, like, it'll be, like, unique, I guess, you know what I mean?

It doesn't have to be even unique, but, like. .

So walk me through it one more time.

So what would you.

I'm just, you find a way to take other pieces of like, code or data.

Like, maybe maybe you could do it in like a way where, like, if you take a link from something that you that someone's looking to sell, and then you run the link through your , your thing, and then it gives you like, you know, like something for your character.

Yeah.

You know what I mean?

In the game.

It gives you an item.

You know what I mean?

And depending on, you know, there'll be certain factors on rarity that people are looking for, things to chase, like, you know, like that.

Almost like a Ginu , or like, you could switch into that POV or something, something like that.

Something like that.

What was that N64 game where you had the little bug or chip and you could switch between bodies?

I don't know.

It was like a space game. And I remember you like this little bug.

Oh, man, I used to just played it at your house before.

It's Parasite.

Let me grab this.

One second.

Okay.

Can you see me and the screen or you just see the screen?

I vote.

Oh, okay.

So Digimon has fusions.

Ble bleach kind of had fusions.

They would fuse with like those demon things, like whatever the fuck they're called, kind of.

They like, became them.

You ever watch bleach?

No, but I remember a few.

I remember being a big, like, fan favorite of people.

So that shit you can pull from maybe. Would say one.

So hold on one second.

Stevenseiverse.

Okay, okay, hold on.

I'm going to start listing these.

Hold on, let me write these down.

Stephen Universe and Stephen Universe.

Fuck.

Okay.

Okay.

Monster Rancher.

Five, you son of a bitch.

Um, mythological transformations.

So we've mentioned belief bleach.

Monster.

Rancher.

Digimon.

Steven Universe.

Stephen Universe.

And a cool thing about Steven Universese is that it incorporates, like, you know, real shit.

Like their old gems are, like, all, you know, they're aphy, opal, pearl, they're all, like, associated with elements or whatever you want.

Oh.

Yeah, yeah, okay.

Not elements.

Yeah, because we'd have to land on, like a visual aesthetic that was probably light, you know, to be, you know, it's not gonna going to be one of those.

What's like, you know, a triple, what are they called AA games or whatever.

It's not going to be like that.

It'll be like.. It's like if I Did you on Steven Universe?

Look at that a monster rancher.

It's just for the code idea.

Yeah.

And degenerating things.

Because that's kind of like what NFTs are.

You know what I mean?

Exactly. Code.

That's kind of like the first ofTs and I go, like.

So yeah, that's what I'm trying to tap into a bit is like making things that people are unique to people.

It's personalization .

It's unique.

It's always new, and then if you find something really cool that you like, it's feeding off the collectible want.

Well, that's what was cool about Monster.

I thought you needed a physical item to run to put into the PlayStation, you know what I mean?

So, like, if you have physical items attached to the code, then that's the best way.

Oh, Space Station Silicon Valley was the game I was talking about.

Space Station.

It sounds familiar, but I don't.

I gotta look at it.

I don't know.

Oh, I don't You remember or you don't?

I remember it.

I just didn't really play this that much.

Just look, I'm gonna.

This game looked so horrible.

That game, it's ridiculous.

I don't even think this was 64 bits.

I think they just they stopped at like 50 so fuck it.

Oh.

It was a real quick game.

Yeah, what does it even say that it does?

Like, I'm looking at it, the description doesn't even describe its game, it's gameplay.

I't the way you pulled that one from.

I feel like your cousin Stevie showed it to us or something.

I can't figure out what's going on with the windows on the phone right now. Bad about.

Hold on, I'm almost...

Oh, did I just drawn you a screen?

Yeah, Oh, wow, shit, that's cool.

I mean, did I No, I want to get it to.

Oh, here we go.

I want to put it somewhere where it's interesting.

Oh, people do fuse, apparently.

Oh, no, they' they're.

Yeah.

Um..

One sec.

I don't know.

My landl looks like in the pool, I feel like a shade.

I still got a shad boat in the middle of the street also, too.

At 1053. At night.s.

Oh, shit, it is late.

There's nos no way around being shady for us...

So, you know, this kind of all started when I was like thinking of.

I was like on Nike.

Nike's the winged sandals, but Nike isn't the Hermes.

Like Nike, obviously the shoe. Statue that was right by your house.

Yeah.

But, you know, Hermes has the wing sandals, right?

And then Nike took the wing sandal and put put it to the god Nike.

And so that was the fusion of those two.

And so as I was discussing that with the chat, I was like, oh, it's fused.

And it started we started like getting through it, and that way.

I was like, oh shit, that's kind of crazy. .

And then obviously this could spin out into something like, it could be an RPG game or whatever it could really spin out into.

So you like Gemini the best?

Well, Gemini is the first multiodal, which means it was trained on all media, not just words.

So all the other ones are language-based.

Gemini's the first multiodal out of all of them.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

And so...

I didn't know that.

It literally creates really, almost, really well done, things right off the bat.

And what I do is once it makes errors, I just grab the error and I throw it into another chat, like a different one, and it critiques it and it fixes it like it's like, boom, it starts it's pretty crazy, bro. ..

I wish people would start making.oon characters our life into real people.

What do you mean?

They' fucking all my feeds on shit's like.

It's like all fucking shorts and reels.

It's like it's like, what if your favorite TV women' real people?

Show a picture of a cheap and like it's like an AI hot girl that looks like you .

And she is they're hot, though you're saying, right?

They're hot as fuck, I look real. Real people.

I'm just saying, like, they know, but it like I don't need to see this.

One I don't care, too.

It's like, I can picture it, like it's just on that side of the gym.

I can .

They did it at the same Simpoms once and the Simpsons was terrifying.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

They do it with all different types of shit.

It's like, all right, I get it.

I know all the anime bitches are hot.

I get it.

Oh, so it's starting to go again.

Let me refresh it till you can see.

One of the AI people complained about, he complained about people doing that there with you was like, it's leasting so much processing power returning. .

Yeah, well, I mean, most of the internet's porn, so it doesn't really matter.

Who cares?

He's.

I'm.

Let me show you something really quick, so you can see how I want to show you how quick something could get made in freaking Gemini.

So I'm going to grab this fusion thing on all the animes.

Let's see.

Have you tried?

No, but I was I had a drug dealer in my car and he was talking to me about how.

He's like like, yeah, bro, oh, use AI.

And I was like, yeah, I'm using it to build this application.

He goes, oh, I use it to make porn.

And sometimes I get them really young.

And I'm like, oh my fucking God.

Wow.

Way too comfortable with telling me that.

That's crazy.

That's.

So you't?

No, but I I'm afraid of how dark it.

You know, a lot of the things that stop me in life are like, oh, God, how deep does the rabbit hole go?

Yeah, I guess.

Why?

Well, tell me.

No, I tried I was clicking on one, you know, I was on like I asked for us, so I was going through it it's like, you, it could you, like, you a bunch of questions because it's like what you like the most.

And then like then I got to the end of it took like two minutes.

Then it's like, it was a paywall.

I was like, well, I don't have a fucking Visa gift card to sign up right now, so this will be for another day.

I'm not putting that on a credit card.

Well, yeah, you could you could..

He's like, oh, I put my X's on there, I put..

Oh, my God.

I'm like, " I'm sure you you're not just jer You're not just jerking off the way.

Like you're That's crazy.

Yo, I just passed Kingdom Hearts.

I'm like, "Oh, that's kind of what this could kind of be.

Like it would be a meeting of different IPs eventually.

Which is what was so cool, right?

Like what was so cool about Kingdom Harts when it first came out, like, what was so special about it?

It was crossing Final Fant.

That was the big thing.

It was Final Fantasy, which is why the magic's why I was like trying to explain the hype of the magic Final Fantasy thing to people.

Like, the Final Fant people go crazy, you know what I mean?

But anything, that that they're involved in, if it's good.

That's where clouds started looking cool.

You had this new outfit on.

Yes, yes, yes, yes.

I remember the last secret boss was in the Hercules Arena, and it was Sep. If you could clear all the trials of the Hercules on Corna. At the end.

And it was Disney, obviously, the two.

Yeah, but felt I kind of felt like we were overlooking the Disney part.

We were like overlooking the Disney part to get to the.

Yeah, I mean, yeah, I was hyped.

I was not a fantasy more than it was Disney.

But I was still like Disney too.

I mean, I was working at Disney.

You know what I mean?

I'm still into it for Disney too, but. .

I was definitely into it because I. Oh, symbiots?

Mbi?

Oh, yeah, yeah, symbates.

I forgot about that, yeah, Venoms, your carnages, all that.

Anyway, let's do this.

Oh, man, I give me two more minutes and I'll be done with.

I'm just trying to find these old threads to throw in there.

I'm just walking around smoking.

Okay.

And we're coming up with ideas, so it's kind of it's helpful.

Oh, there's a Pokémon right here.

What is it of?

It's, uh..

It's a vile.

It's all fucked up.

A gloom or a v.

One of the first 150?

Yeah.

Remember the.

Hold on.

It's like a little plant guy.

He'sing?

He's on opiates.

Yeah, it's fucked up.

I think it is an opiate.

It is Op. Because the Asians can't Japanese won't do.

I don't think they do drugs.

Like, they just..

Oh, my God.

I don't feel like pulling it up now because I have to look up head. Address and be pain.

But, bro, I funded this guy and I looked up his crib, because I knew he was rich, and , bro, one of his rooms had a straight up opium den in it, like. Like one of his houses was insane.

And he had a it was a great red room.

Like, you know what I mean?

Like, everything was like red and gold.

This guy Chinese to.

And, it had like a big ass hook just chilling, like, clean in the middle of the room.

Like, I'm seeing this shit on like, Trulia or whatever, you know what I mean?

What's that?

And uh What's Trulia?

I could just.

It's like, will you sell homes and shit.

Okay.

Like, I'm just like peeping like, you know, I guess whenever you bought it, like, what the pictures were, or whenever, I don't know, just whatever you updated the pictures to be.

And, bro, I'm telling you, it was a straight up opium then in one of the rooms.

It was insane.

Yes, this guy. Had well.

Everything was floorb.

Yeah, it was very low.

It was very low to to the floor scenario.

Plenty of things to smoke nearby, no TVs.

It was just meant to put maxing and relaxing.

Oh, cool.

Well, no, Miyaki doesn't have.. Any fusion.

He has transformations.

Yeah.

Oh, oh, how did I not.

You know, I thought about it at first, but then I didn't think about it deeply enough..

This is obviously a really good one, I guess.

Now I think about it.

Neon Genesis, Evangelian.

Oh, the, they're robots, right?

Not much much more than robots.

That's what's so cool about it is that, you want me to tell you, like, the actual plot, like, deeply into the plot and the story?

Please.

That's the whole point.

I guess, the robots are their parents, like the one that Shinji, the main character drives, is like, made out of his mother's biological biological materials and fused with the robot to become like a sentthient creature.

And the reason he's the only person able to pilot it efficiently is because, like, when he gets into it, and like, it feels a bit flued, they call it LCO, that's like supposed to represent, like going back into, like, the sack, like of your mother, and like the amniotic field is filling off.

And like, that's why you can comes and sync with it so well, and able to pilot it.

And the same thing with the girl.

It's a bio it's a biotech fusion.

It's a bieapon.

Cool.

The machine itself is a biotech fusion, and then it requires someone with the correct DNA to pilot it also, correctly, for it to come alive.

Neogenesis, let's say.

Evangelian, neon Genesis.

The neon Genesis Evangelian.

I'm sorry. Know you're mixing me up.

Neon Genesis.

That's my favorite anime ever.

Dude, my little brother, Rocco's friend was over, they're like sophomore.

And I was like, oh, what an are you guys like?

And he goes, neon Genesis.

I'm like, really?

It's .

I was like, it's a slow one.

You like that one?

He goes, yeah, I really like it.

And I'm like, cool.

That one goes deep into like psychological things, deep into, has a lot of religious allegories.

You know, you could Wikipedia and go into a very deep dive in the Jones, you know what I'm saying, and all the symbolism and everything that that show has. Very, very deep.

I just remembered you could like that like two weeks ago.

Like this.

Like a samurai or like, no, I feel like a I like I thought it was cool for a while, and I was doing it for a long time, and then I just stopped one day and I stopped like a year.

And like I just remembered that you do it together.

I have a Spanish keyboard on my show too.

We could do a lingo, so I couldommend like Spanish words and shit to me too now.

It's funny.

How well do you feel like you know Spanish?

Well, I got to level right now I'm on level 14, which is where Jessica's sister started. And Jessica started.

So I know as much as two people who grew up in a Spanish speaking household who didn't apply themselves to their Spanish.

I lost you.

Yo.

I don't.

Did you, um, lose, um. A service?

I don't know that happened.

Oh, no. Yeah.

So I mean, I know, like, I know a little bit if I go into the store and there's like signs and Spanish, like .

I know a little bit, you know, like simple dialogues.

Well, they said I heard someone said, like, if you basically go if you go to a country, you could learn it in a month if you really, really want to.

But there's this cool app called Hello Talk, and what it does that lets you talk to someone who wants to learn English from that country you want to learn their language in.

Does that make Yeah Yeah, it's called hello Talk and basically you' be like, oh, I want to learn Spanish.

So it'll give you It'll pair you with someone who wants to speak English, who speaks Spanish?

It's Okay, um Watch.

Let me.

I want to show you the thing the app I did for Rob.

For the countless things I'm doing for my dad, he looks at it for five seconds and goes, "Oh.

Where is it?

Oh, the Legion Command Center.

I he is he has been consistent if nothing else.

Rob has?

Yeah.

Yeah, for sure.

And he's not going to stop doing it ever.

So right now, it's it's just this interface, but..

I'm going to turn it into an actual, like animated 3D game..

No, no, no.

This is a good style.

It looks cool, right?

This is a really good. This is what I was thinking about.

So look, it has these are the functions of it.

It has, you know, you could make strategic access for your, you know, for your ideas.

Like, how to find people, how to ..

So let's think, um to find the hero you were born to lead, this is your core warrior archetype, or let's do guild charter.

Describe the desired culture and purpose of your community. Hard-working and kind gamers Oh, I guess an error.

But, I added the functions I'm going to add are.

You're gonna be able to have a let me show you how.

It's going to be, what we ad shit.

You know, an animated background so you could pick like either space shooting or lasers or just different game animations and all sorts of stuff.

I'm going to show you when I finish it and you'll see how much it changed.

Okay.

So I think you brought up before, but I didn't realize it or I look at this like this, like the way you're putting things and stuff.

Does anyone merge something like what you have right here?

It's like a DD?

I don't know.

I'm not sure.

If you do that basically what that is, like, if you could do that, it's like, it's like a B&D character sheet, you know, what's the backcory?

What's just that?

You know what I mean?

So, like, if you could, I don't know, find ways to input something and have it output like sick characters for you and then like even have like give it the art forum.

Yeah, that's kind of like, so, okay, so what would you want it to have?

Like, what would you want it to have?

Like, uh, I guess, like help me, like, uh, I come up with cool, like backstories and stuff, you know what I mean?

Like, you're giving it like traits that you want your character to be.

Like, you know what I mean?

Like, no on the character to be like, uh , you know, like, like, shady, uh, non-aggressive, uh, comes from, like, you know, criminals family. You know, and then, like, kind of in, like, just like, Okay.

So .

Okay, so I, you know, I guarantee you, once I'm going to grab this fusion thread, once I'm looking for the last few C GBT threads that I missed.

I'm going to give it to Grock and it's it's going to turn it into instructions to give to Gemini to make a game out of it.

Watch.

Just Hmm?

Roger, man meth fusion engine. .

For some reason, you got a lot lower.

I don't know why.

I was just whispering.

I definitely need a Z right now.

Yeah, I'd like one, too, actually.

It would be nice.

I got.

Let's see what what it said about Neonenesis.

Oh, yeah, that's got a lot of stuff.

Oh, it kind of ties into all of them, transformation, fusion, evolution, and possession, and symbiote.

Yeah.

That's like, I thought about it at first, but I was like, I was like, I don't know, I didn't I don't know why I didn't say it.

I was like, maybe that's, like.

But it really is too it's like, too good.

Look, I think I have everything. .

And then this would leave room, you know, if we have this ultimate universe where everyone could kind of show up in, then it leaves room to have your own like original characters. And I have this idea for these original characters who are just basically like the laws of physics, you know, like the ultimate power of physics, but for every positive, like so every positive thing they could do, it has to have an equal and opposite realaction to it.

So if you move time backwards, something kinetically or logically would have to happen, that was the negative of that, in a sense.

Okay.

So they're like the ultimate they have the ultimate power, but it has a weight to it, you know, a negative recoil.

I'll show you that.

Bro, this is crazy and Yeah, I think I'm done.

Okay, let's go back.

I think I'm done.

Ow.

Ooh, Hydra might be a cool name for this, because of the multi heads.

Ooh, what about this?

I bet you never heard of this before.

I bet no game does this.

You know how, for instance, Zelda, what gameplay loops are what's the game you've been playing off in?

Or played recently?

I have to be honest.

So think of .

Well, think of an MMO.

Think of a game that has that's big, expansive, and that it often has multiple different types of gameplay loops, right?

Like Zelda.

Yeah, so what are those loops?

You character, so the cool thing about it is like, if you to you know how like, a world work is, you want to play a ranger, you make a character, it's a ranger, and you live up the 60s, and if you want a warlock, you got to make it a separate character there and make it a warlock.

So that game didn't do that.

Like, you make one character , and they use the crystals as like their souls, basically.

And you just switch out your crystal based on your class.

So like you could, you could be you could have a crystal heart of, I just consider it their heart.

Like if you have a crystal heart as a monk and then you could level it to 20 then you just change your crystal.

And it's like they consider it like your soul just gets to like come out of transmuted basically, and now you're a wizard, then you can level that.

So like that's what.

You have one cast and be every class.

Cool.

So in that game, what what you what are you actually doing in the game?

It's an RPG?

I don't.

Yeah, so you could do a dungeon, right?

Yeah, you doaids, you do.

You could go looking for a foresting or foraging, you could probably make items, right?

Okay.

Explore.

So, my point is, basically, I bet there's no game that gives you more of the loop that you want to play, right?

So, like, let's say you're playing Zelda, and that loop is, you could do a dungeon, and you could do an exploration.

You could advance the story.

You could do , whatever you want, you know, and instead of just, because how do you best to explain it?

Does it kind of make sense what I'm saying?

Whatever loop of the game you like best, it gives you more of that so you could just play more of that loop instead of having to do parts of the game that you don't like in a way.

Because it would be generative in that sense.

What am I trying to say?

But then I'm thinking about it, I'm like, oh, the loops, the part of the game that you like, the gameplay loop, because I have you heard of this term gameplay loop before?

Or it's not.

Okay, yeah.

The parts of the games that you don't like make you like the other parts better, essentially.

So I don't know.

That's.

I was going to say, people don't always know what they like the time..ad bit.

Okay, cool.

I'm about to dump this into here, so hold on.

I don'troad can't explore, you know, I want to be some sort of structure Yeah, no, of course.

How do I make a Okay,'t important, but .

I't .

FaceTimeimed me. Went to had some crazy the fucking community that grandma lives in, like the town in.

I think she's in like Jacksonville outside of town.

You said they live in, yeah, Jacksonville's like very north.

It's by Townville.

Yeah.

No, no, not by Tampa at all.

Tampa's west of it, but on the top of Florida for sure, yeah.

I think it's in Jacksonville.

CBS.

Wait, what?

CBS neighborhood is so .

Wait. .

Wait, wait. Don't Wait, I don't get it.

CVS Eas?

Yeah, I .

Okay, okay, okay.

I'm not joking.

It says that on the CV.

Well, Florida is very Spanish.

Wow.

I forgot why I was saying that, but .

Oh, I remember.

Oh, yeah, so her mom' visit her.

That's why she's pick up right now. She went to the target there or whatever the fuck's the she was in, and she FaceTimed me, they had all the Lord of the Rings magic gathering, which is like, I don't know how the fuck they had that'cause that shit got out of print like two years ago.

A year and a half ago, they had a shitload with them and she's like, you on?

She's like, I know you like mag want these fuck yeah, buy them all.

And she sent them?

Nice.

She. For it Okay, okay. .

Yeah, what is it?

It's At least that's's your problem, not a fucking, not, um. , like, you' they're not smuggling Florida fucking drugs up there..

I mean, she spent like, it was like 300 bucks I over her.

It wasn't, like, like. .

I have it under all those clothes, so I don't get the urge to crack the crack.

It's still valuable.'s the field. .

So this is just just one, doubles. .

Wait, oh, it's the magic.

Hold on.

Show me again.

Sorry.

So this is one box of that you, maybe I'll this is the one that I really to show you.

I got..

I have four seal play boxes. .

Oh, how many, how many cards come in the booster?

There's 30 packs in these.

And you're not opening them or you are?

No, these are all sealed.

I opened the one for myself, but .

I'm leaving sealed for tomorrow.

So I got four of those.

And I got four of these bundles, which like come with certain stuff.

I like how clean and nice they are.

They're like very aesthetically nice.

And the bundles have chase cards, you get in the bundles, like a special separate.

I have all that they need this one's cloud on it But this is the real juicer.

Oh, how many versions of each like, are there multiple clouds, multiple Sephoths?

I have all of them.

There's like six of them with different characters and then they have like the star deck, which is like you get a cloud and a separate deck.

S with cloud, Champion.

So it's like, like two star decks,60 part decks.

I guess that's what're me. Before.

Like you could just pick this up and play.

You know, I was trying to figure out like, how many cards on the base level would you need to make a game out of, you know?

Yeah, you would need so 120, I guess.

So this is two 60 card decks, so you need 120 cards, 60 free each player. .

Yeah, I want to do research on that that.

I want to figure out, like.

Let's.

But this is the other format I was telling you that, this is a 100 card format and around you..

What do I know that character from?

This is from the Fasy I was just telling you about.

Okay.

She's in that, yeah, she's that.

So these are the commander decks.

These are pretty built 100 decks for the specifically I. And your deck can only be your commander's colorless.

Like, you can't mix other shit.

Oh, okay, cool.

And you can only have the Colton Duck Comander is you could use a card from any arrow.

It could be a 25 year old card, but you only have to have one copy of each card, and you're deck., which is in standard, when you have a 60 card deck, you're trying to fill it up basically with four copies of your best cards .

So, in essence, your 60 card deck is really only, like, 20 cards that get you got four copies each or whatever.

And there's 15 cards that you got four copies each kind.

You know what I mean?

So, like, command is cool because you have 100 different cards from any other.ror.

Because in the standard, the sets rotate out.

So you buy the new ones.

This is the other one from Final Fantasy 3 or 6 or something.

The other commander does, he likes has different colors.

What are those.

Let me see the go back again to her.

What are those three circles?

She has swamp plains and mountain.

So, like, you know, they like, like, mean different stuff.

They all have, like certain like, the top is, like, what their theme is, revival trend.

So, like, what she does is she mills cards into the graveyard , and then she has the deck space around magic to cast things out of the graveyard.

So you're basically like, kind of like, you know, you're putting your deck into the graveyard, but then you're cheaply taking it out.

Cool. .

Yeah, that's something that would have to get worked out, right?

Like how, how, oh, the magic system, you know, like the.

Yeah, they created their own their own stuff like cheer propitis.

Like, that was never a ability on a card.

But like, that's one of his abilities in the game, you know what I mean?

So they, yeah, that's a good.

It's tight time.

And the fourth and final one of those is a cloud.

Well, that's a cool one.

Is that holographic?

Yeah, they come with h this is what I really wanted to show you.

This is the real news is I have Oh, that's, uh.

That's nice.

It's pretty, shiny.

So this is you could only get the cereal.

Cool.

See, okay, so do you see, is there is there digital versions of any of this stuff?

Yeah.

Okay.

See, that's exactly how you were supposed to approach things.

Like you're supposed to do a free version for expansion and for everyone.

You do a light , a real, like a analog version version at a decent price, and then you do really expensive stuff for the collectors and like you hit all markets.

Yeah, like the difference in price like this came out at $1 80.

And now it's too kind of not continue there.

Okay.

Interesting.

These came out retail for like 70 bucks, 75 bucks.

I mean, they're all over that right now, but I mean, Cloud is the most expensive one, and he's selling for 20 right now, this command one, the five.

These came out retail, like $720.

They're $1,300 each.

No, not TCD player.

So these almost double. Price already.

What's the What's the hype?

Because collect those , you could only get the cerealized cards and use the truck folks and the truck folks, and you get much more h chances of getting the full art cars, like like the T5 Chju, and you get all like those special cards that are in it.

You get the much higher chances in here than the year.

Like you're going to get basically all oils and bards and stuff in these.

And these are just going to get mostly b.

Okay, that's interesting.

But that's why this is $200 and this is $1,300 ago But, yeah, this is like, uh.

Well you. 





Summary

A digital component is included with each physical Dragon Ball card game purchase. This component includes a serial code that can be redeemed for a digital pack in the online game, which features additional chase cards not found in the physical game. The digital game also offers pre-built decks that can be redeemed using a corresponding code.

Transcript

At the last card is a serial code.

And then you punch that into their app on, like their online app where you could play online and play against the computer.

And then it gives you a pack to rip on the game on the online game.

Wait, so what is it?

Sorry, one more time?

So for every physical you buy of the Dragon game, like a Dragon Ball card game, a new one? .

No, whatever..

It comes at the end with the card that just has a serial coat on it.

And then you launch the app. And then you punch in the serial code and it gives you a pack to rip in the game.

So then you have your digital card.

It's not the same.

It's not the same pack as the one you just ripped.

It's like another random pack.

And the digital , and the digital game has like more chase cards in it.

That's. Don't exist in real life.

Like there's four versions of a lot of cards in this.

I see.

And in real life, there's usually only two or three, maybe tops.

Okay, that's cool.

But this is why I started collecting these at first, because I was like, it was fun ripping the online packs too.

And of course, you could buy gems with real money to rip more packs if you want, you know, shit like that. .

Is there any way that it can and you know, it could go a step further and it could get, how do you say?

More personalized, more you exactly, you know?

Like, John's.

You have your own separate collection.

You know what I mean?

So it's like you have your physical collection, then you have your digital collection.

Cool.

Okay.

And they have started they have like prebu decks, too, and like, if you punch in the prebuilt de code, they give you the prebuilt deck on this. Something that matches, which makes sense.

But this shit's really good, like, they made this really nice.

It's under maintenance right now, I can't log in.

I was gonna show you the digital.

Ooh, that would be cool if you if you if it pulls up, like, your own fusion, or, like, your own, like, generator, story generator, and then you could throw your own cards in, it would create its own stories or something like that, like stuff like that.

I'm trying to figure out out.

You know?

Basically own.

Oh, that's that's like what you're kind of saying.

Like, you know, like that RPG maker?

Make sure you on the RPG?

No, what's that?

Oh, Buff has been using that for years.

Um to make like little Final Fantasy games and stuff.

RPG Maker.

It'd probably come a long way by now.

And then he uploaded them to RPG Maker, which is like a separateate game.

It was really just a sandbox to build games. And can't make like dumb little games that were like five minutes long, and hed like, not go over and buy them, look at this and be like a stupid.

It's like a thumb He like a thumb drag .

It always, it's like unraveling.

It's like when they dig for dinosaur bones, you know what I mean?

You don't always get right what you mean, but you get to other things.

And by rambling and brainstorming, we found a lot of different new ideas that we would have never had, you know?

If that makes sense, you know?

I think so.

Yeah, I just hope you can put them together, you.

No, trust me, I mean, I feel the same way.

Like, I have all this rambling, weird thought patterns and stuff, but with, like, AI, you could help it could you could be chaotic, and then that thing could be..
